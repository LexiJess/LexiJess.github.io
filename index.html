### Instructions

* Open the [Resources](Resources) folder. Here we have a relatively simple spreadsheet.

* Create a new HTML document and create a table to represent the data in the spreadsheet.

* Try to get the formatting as close to the spreadsheet as possible.

* **Bonus:** Use table `colspan` and `border` attributes to make the table look even more similar to the spreadsheet.

  * Group the completed table using a `thead`, a `tbody`, and a `tfoot` element. 

    * A good example of these semantic table elements being used can be found here: <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table#More_Examples>
