API-call data used to visualize weather patterns around the world. Using python, HTML, API calls, Bootstrap, MatPlotLib. 

Welcome to my visualizations of API-call data about weather reporting around the globe. I used a set of data and visualizations from a previous project (https://github.com/LexiJess/python-api-challenge) and added the graphics and visualizations. The analyses are pretty straightforward--the visualizations speak for themselves. The largest difference in this project is the data page of this website. It shows all the data that went into making the visualizations and analyses. It's iteresting to see the data in a dynamic table, if only because it shows how large and cumbersome looking at big data sets is without data wrangling tools. 

Enjoy the tour of weather features compared to latitude!
